        questions:`1 Do I need to relicense an item each time I use it?`,
        answers: `1 Yes you do. You need a license for each end project. This ensures contributors are paid
        for your usage of each asset & you and your clients have the legal right to use the item.`,

        questions:`2 Do I need to relicense Fonts or Addons each time I use them in a project?`,
        answers: `2 No, you do not need to relicense fonts or addons for each project. You only need to register them once for the
        installation on your device. If registering a font or addon to another computer you use, you need to issue a new
        license for that installation.`,

        questions:`3 Do I need to credit the author of the item?`,
        answers: `3 No, it's not mandatory to give the author credit. But we do encourage that if your end product has credits as part
        of its design (such as a film or TV show), please credit the author and Envato. Also, as the author retains
        ownership of the item, you shouldn't claim copyright in the item.`,

        questions:`4 Can I mix two Envato Elements website templates together?`,
        answers: `4 Yes, you can modify the items you download on Elements to create a customised implementation of the item. The
        license starts when you Register your use of the item and the license is only valid if you complete the End Product
        while your subscription is active. Then the license continues for the life of the End Product (even if your
        subscription ends).`,

        questions:`5 When I use a font in Merchandising, must I combine with another asset?`,
        answers: `5 No you do not. Fonts can be used on their own, so long as you do not redistribute the font itself to any other
        person.`,
